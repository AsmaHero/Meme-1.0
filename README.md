# Overview:
The Meme Editor View consists of an image view overlaid by two text fields, one near the top and one near the bottom of the image. This view has a bottom toolbar with two buttons: one for the camera and one for the photo album. The top navigation bar has a share button on the left displaying Apple’s stock share icon and a “Cancel” button on the right.

# Specification:
The app has three view controller scenes:

**- Login View:** Allows the user to log in using their Udacity credentials, or (as an extra credit exercise) using their Facebook account
**-  Map and Table Tabbed View:** Allows users to see the locations of other students in two formats.  
**- Information Posting View:** Allows the users specify their own locations and links.
